# Test Document for RAG System

## Introduction
This is a test document to verify the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system functionality.

## Key Information
- This document contains sample information about machine learning
- RAG systems combine retrieval and generation for better AI responses
- Vector databases store document embeddings for similarity search

## Machine Learning Basics
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed.

### Types of Machine Learning:
1. **Supervised Learning**: Uses labeled data to train models
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Finds patterns in unlabeled data  
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Learns through interaction with environment

## Vector Databases
Vector databases are specialized storage systems that:
- Store high-dimensional vector representations
- Enable fast similarity search
- Support AI/ML applications like RAG systems

## Conclusion
This test document helps verify that the document upload and processing pipeline works correctly in the RAG system.
